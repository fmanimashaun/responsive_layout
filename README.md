# To Do list

## Overview

In this project, I built a simple HTML list of To Do tasks with focus on it structure using Javascript to load the html elements dynamically. In  addition, I implemented the CRUD (create, read, update, delete) methods as a way to add, remove or update the task list. This simple web page was built using webpack and served by a webpack dev server.
